\title{Distance-based Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (dbICC)}
\usage{
dm2icc(dmat, nsub, nmea)
}
\arguments{
\item{dmat}{A distance matrix or a object of \code{dist}, of dimension \code{sum(nmea)*sum(nmea)}. Note that the order of the rows or
columns in the distance matrix is sorted by groups of measurements for each subject or individual. The details refer to
Reiss el at., 2019.}

\item{nsub}{Number of the subject or individual.}

\item{nmea}{A vector containing number of the measurement for each subject or individual; 
if \code{nmea} is a scalar, it means each subject shares the same number of the measurement.}
}
\value{
A scalar, giving the dbICC value
}
\description{
When the distance among any test-retest datatype can be defined, its reliability 
performed in Reiss et al. (2019) can be obtained by this function, to calculate the 
value of dbICC through the related distance matrix. A sample of the certain subjects with 
the replacement, which is used in the boostrap confidence intervals, can be reached 
as well.
}
\details{
Schematic diagram of a matrix of distances among repeated observations of
nine subjects, with rows and columns grouped by subject. Distances in the half-squares along
the diagonal are within-individual (W), while the rest are between-individual
