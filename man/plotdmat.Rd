\title{Plot the distance matrix in dbICC}
\usage{
plotdmat(dmat, nsub, nmea, xlab = NULL)
}
\arguments{

\item{nsub}{Number of the subject or individual}

\item{nmea}{A vector containing number of the measurement for each subject or individual; 
if \code{nmea} is a scalar, it means each subject shares the same number of the measurement.}

\item{xlab}{The title for the x axis}

\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
